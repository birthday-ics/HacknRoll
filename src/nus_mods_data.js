This module will impart the concepts and techniques of analysing the effectiveness of conservation policies and strategies, which is especially challenging in observational studies where it may be impractical (or unethical) to have properly randomized or controlled replicates. Examples of such techniques include meta-analyses, propensity score matching, and interrupted time-series analysis.

    "description": "Adapting to the ongoing digitization of the economy, and of society in general, is arguably the most challenging transformation every business is currently facing. Digital technologies have become the core of almost every industry. Rapidly advancing technologies and digital trends, changing customer behaviours, and disruptive competitors are making it increasingly difficult for organisations to drive sustainable and profitable growth. CEOs report that many of their digital transformation efforts fail and our research is showing that up to 70% of organisations failed to exceed their return on digital investment goals. Leaders are well aware of the need to transform but are desperately in need of direction as to how to change and even where change is required. This specific course will focus on execution of digital strategy in the “real world” and equip students with some of the tools to be kept in mind in this rapidly changing paradigm.",

Besides covering investment theory, the class will be required to apply the methodology into real life applications and translate these applications into actual portfolio strategies.

    "description": "In a competitive environment, entrepreneurship is an essential and indispensable element in the success of every business organization - whether small or large, new or long-established. This course focuses on entrepreneurship, the processes involved in creating and exploiting new, innovative resource combinations and opportunities. The emphasis of innovation is made explicit in the course title.\n\nThis course focuses on two primary objectives. First to understand how one can enhance and increase innovativeness in any context. Innovation means that a new product, a new service or a new process is developed and pushed into the market. The range, scope, and complexity of the\nissues related to the creating and implementing something new is discussed. At the end of the course, the students will have learnt how to innovate.\n\nThe second objective of this course is to provide students with an opportunity for “hands-on” knowledge on starting an entrepreneurial firm. This objective will be accomplished by developing new ideas and asking the question on how one can implement them in the market and by doing\nhands-on interviews with entrepreneurs who have gone through the experience of founding a new venture.\n\nThe course utilizes class discussions of weekly assignments, brief lectures and case discussion. The course is based on an evidence-based management perspective in which there is careful discussion of what is known, what is conjecture, what is (useful) gut feeling and where does new knowledge come from and how it can be used. Discussion of assigned readings and cases and the completion of a field project are integral to meeting the course objectives.",

    "description": "Interest in entrepreneurship within established organisations has intensified due to various events taking place on business and social levels. On the social front, there is a rising interest among employees to create something meaningful on their own. Increasingly, employees have a strong need for individual autonomy and expression in their workplace. In the absence of such freedom, talented employees may leave out of frustration to search for an institution that can provide the meaning and the environment to achieve their self-actualization. Corporate entrepreneurship is one method of stimulating and capitalizing on employees’ need to think of new ideas and do things better for their organisation. On a business level, an organization needs self-renewal, which involves transformation through redefinition of its business concepts, reorganization of its business relationships and reengineering of its business processes. Creating a new venture from scratch is challenging, but developing it within an existing organization is a totally different ball game. This module focuses on corporate entrepreneurship with four key elements: new business venturing, innovativeness, selfrenewal and proactiveness. It has two primary objectives. First, the module aims to enable the students to apply corporate entrepreneurship-related concepts in practice. Second, it seeks to broaden the students’ education by helping them to appreciate the application of corporate entrepreneurship knowledge to companies. The students will also have the opportunity to meet corporate entrepreneurs to understand their challenges and strategic approaches in creating and capturing value for their organizations.",

Because of the many components in marketing, doing it on a global scale involves having to work with different levels of economic, educational, infrastructural, legal, political and cultural development. Global marketing adds exponential complexity to the task of marketing.",

    "description": "This is a course that is meant for two important marketing mix variables, channel management and pricing. In Channel Management, not much attention is usually paid to understanding marketing channels in detail. In fact people used to call channels the `dark continent of marketing, that is best left to `truckers?. But, is this true? One can make at least four observations: long term commitment of channel related decisions, existence of channel power play, market dynamics caused by channel changes, and the impact of internet on channel intermediaries. All these issues are very difficult to comprehend and solve if we do not understand what channels are for. Channel management is not just managing the retailers and the trucks and delivery personnel, but it is much larger than that. In Pricing, the one element of marketing strategy that is least understood and hence constantly feared by many managers is pricing. This is because pricing is a very complex issue. On one hand, it is supposed to reflect all the strategic steps the company has taken to bring the product to the consumer and convince him/her to buy it as well. On the other hand, it is supposed to reflect what the consumer would get out of the product by paying that price to acquire it. Will there be a match between the two? Perhaps and perhaps not. This dilemma makes it imperative for a manager needs to understand and analyze various factors in arriving at an appropriate pricing strategy. And, pricing does not operate in vacuum. It has to be married with other elements of the marketing strategy, including the channel management we discuss in this course. Thus, understanding the broader picture of the various elements of pricing, and building a scientific framework on pricing will always be reliable and better in the long run.",

Second is to introduce\nthe diversity of business environments in Asia—the range is as diverse as exists worldwide. There is no single Asian business environment, but instead\nmany different environments, each of which has different implications for business strategy. In canvassing global firm strategy, it is expected that students will learn a basic set of descriptive facts about various countries and top businesses in the region. Frameworks that fit one context may be useless for another. In this course, the emphasis is not on filling in frameworks and applying standard recipes. On the contrary, students will be expected to challenge recipes, question received wisdom, and exhibit unconventional thinking – all traits required to conduct effective global strategy worldwide.",

This course provides students the opportunity to develop a deep understanding of family firms across Asia, with examples from ASEAN countries, India, China, Korea, and Japan. Aside from a focus on how to sustain a family firm from the perspective of the family, the course will also analyze family firms from an outsider’s perspective, including investors, partners, executives, and policy makers.",

    "description": "This module is divided into two parts. The goal of the first half is to help students develop an intuitive understanding of strategy as a process which will be useful in the second half of the module when we apply this process directly in the context of innovations for emerging markets. While we cover a set of strategic tools, the emphasis is not on filling in frameworks and applying standard recipes. On the contrary, students will be expected to challenge recipes, question received wisdom, and exhibit an understanding of how to apply the frameworks to solve strategic obstacles.\nWhile the cases and the examples used in the module are primarily based on Asia, the lessons from this module apply more generally to emerging markets across Africa and Latin America. Rather than looking for one “right” answer, this module encourages debates and discussions. In some ways, this module is a cross between an executive education module on strategy formulation and implementation and a module on Asian business. Our goal is to help students develop the strategic intuition and tools they need to succeed in these emerging battlegrounds for tomorrow.",

We will also compare and contrast Zheng He’s AoC with the classic Sun Zi’s Art of War (AoW), considering especially the values and principles embedded in these, and evaluating as to when companies should adopt the AoW and/or the AoC.\nThe module will also attempt to move beyond Zheng He to explore related issues, such as similarities and differences between the western and Asian approaches to collaboration and leadership, the idea of Collaborative Quotient (CQ) and its measurement, the modern day relevance of Zheng He’s key act of collaboration in his practice of generosity, and also the practice of collaboration as seen in the world of insects, birds and animals.",

    "title": "Managing Business Networks",
    "description": "This is a course in the design, management, and leadership of networks. It will examine a variety of business-related networks. These include entrepreneurial networks of resource providers and alliance partners; networks of communication and coordination within established organizations; supply chain and marketing channel networks; informal networks in and outside organizations that confer influence and advance careers; cross-border networks for doing business globally.\nManaging in the contemporary global economy is much more about managing networks than hierarchical organizations through fixed chains of command. Both within organizations and between them, the paths to productivity, innovation, and success lie in astute networking. Network management and leadership demand different capabilities from those necessary to run a single firm or division within it. Communication, persuasion, collaboration, negotiation, emotional intelligence, flexibility, trust-building, reciprocity, and responsiveness are all essential. However, good network management requires more than “soft” or interpersonal skills. Given the complexity of business networks today, familiarity with the technical tools of network analysis can be very helpful as well. A highly technical science of networks now exists. Managers should learn how to use that science in analyzing and engineering their networks for superior performance.\nWe will approach the problem of managing networks from two perspectives, “up” and “down.” “Up” refers to your vantage point as an individual actor, crafting your personal network, positioning yourself within it, and leveraging it for professional advantage and success. “Down” is your vantage point as an executive charged with responsibility for the functioning and success of the network as a whole; for example, within a division or functional area or a supply chain or distribution system.",

This course allows you to understand family firms from the perspective of the owning family, outside professionals working in family firms, business partners, employees of family offices, investors in family firms and policy makers. The topics include strategy, growth, ownership, innovation, governance, professionalisation, and succession patterns in family firms, as well as an investor and policy perspective. The course is open to students from all NUS faculties and to exchange students interested understanding business in Asia. For students from business families or entrepreneurs building their own firms this course will be particularly relevant as it will provide the knowledge to run and sustain family businesses for generations. For other students, the course will be useful no matter which career you pursue, as you will most likely work with family firms either as your employers, clients, suppliers, or partners.",

An ASEAN that is tighter in economic integration is pivotal as China is more aggressively competitive since the 1970s with India awakening as well. This course will focus on ASEAN-plus business opportunities for Singapore-based companies to forge business alliances and ventures to tap natural resources in production and markets for sales and revenue.",

As such, family firms play an important role in all economies, but especially so in Asian economies, where large family firms often constitute a large part of the private sector. Large Asian family firms - the focus of this course - are often organized into corporate groups, and this type of economic organization has lost its attractiveness in many other parts of the developed world, but continues to be important in most emerging economies. In many ways, the Asian family firm defies the wisdom of strategic management. Its demise continues to be predicted, but does not appear imminent. This course provides students the opportunity to develop deep skills and understanding of the strategy and governance of family firms, and focuses in particular on strategic issues faced by family firms in Asia. Topics include characteristics, strengths and weaknesses of family ownership and management, succession of ownership and leadership, governance of family businesses, and how to grow and sustain the legacy of family business. The knowledge obtained from this course is particularly essential to doing business intelligently with family firms not only in Asia and other emerging economies but also in developed countries.",

Treating Singapore-Malaysia\nas a nexus to consider its literary relations in\nthe long 20th century with other localities (e.g.,\nmainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong), this course\nintroduces the critical concept of “place” to account for\nthe shifting attributes and implications of the cultural\nlinkages affecting our perspectives on literary heritage.\nThrough literary texts that address questions of\nsojourn, mobility and migration, it highlights the\nimportance of historicisation when analysing literary\ntransregionalism and shows how geographical distance\ndoes not necessarily co-relate with the strength of\nconnections.",

    "description": "In Southeast Asia, the global Cold War coincided with the decolonization process when newly-emerging independent nations were eager to seek powerful international allies and vice versa. As long-term sojourners and settlers in the region, the Chinese migrants and their local-born descendants arguably saw the height of the Cold War as the most challenging period. Although they have experienced creolization and acculturation in their country of destination and birth, their allegiances became suspect after China came under the communist rule. This course examines the policies and experiences of ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia during the Cold War and its aftermath.",
