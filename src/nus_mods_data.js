This module will impart the concepts and techniques of analysing the effectiveness of conservation policies and strategies, which is especially challenging in observational studies where it may be impractical (or unethical) to have properly randomized or controlled replicates. Examples of such techniques include meta-analyses, propensity score matching, and interrupted time-series analysis.

    "description": "Adapting to the ongoing digitization of the economy, and of society in general, is arguably the most challenging transformation every business is currently facing. Digital technologies have become the core of almost every industry. Rapidly advancing technologies and digital trends, changing customer behaviours, and disruptive competitors are making it increasingly difficult for organisations to drive sustainable and profitable growth. CEOs report that many of their digital transformation efforts fail and our research is showing that up to 70% of organisations failed to exceed their return on digital investment goals. Leaders are well aware of the need to transform but are desperately in need of direction as to how to change and even where change is required. This specific course will focus on execution of digital strategy in the “real world” and equip students with some of the tools to be kept in mind in this rapidly changing paradigm.",

Besides covering investment theory, the class will be required to apply the methodology into real life applications and translate these applications into actual portfolio strategies.

    "description": "In a competitive environment, entrepreneurship is an essential and indispensable element in the success of every business organization - whether small or large, new or long-established. This course focuses on entrepreneurship, the processes involved in creating and exploiting new, innovative resource combinations and opportunities. The emphasis of innovation is made explicit in the course title.\n\nThis course focuses on two primary objectives. First to understand how one can enhance and increase innovativeness in any context. Innovation means that a new product, a new service or a new process is developed and pushed into the market. The range, scope, and complexity of the\nissues related to the creating and implementing something new is discussed. At the end of the course, the students will have learnt how to innovate.\n\nThe second objective of this course is to provide students with an opportunity for “hands-on” knowledge on starting an entrepreneurial firm. This objective will be accomplished by developing new ideas and asking the question on how one can implement them in the market and by doing\nhands-on interviews with entrepreneurs who have gone through the experience of founding a new venture.\n\nThe course utilizes class discussions of weekly assignments, brief lectures and case discussion. The course is based on an evidence-based management perspective in which there is careful discussion of what is known, what is conjecture, what is (useful) gut feeling and where does new knowledge come from and how it can be used. Discussion of assigned readings and cases and the completion of a field project are integral to meeting the course objectives.",

    "description": "Interest in entrepreneurship within established organisations has intensified due to various events taking place on business and social levels. On the social front, there is a rising interest among employees to create something meaningful on their own. Increasingly, employees have a strong need for individual autonomy and expression in their workplace. In the absence of such freedom, talented employees may leave out of frustration to search for an institution that can provide the meaning and the environment to achieve their self-actualization. Corporate entrepreneurship is one method of stimulating and capitalizing on employees’ need to think of new ideas and do things better for their organisation. On a business level, an organization needs self-renewal, which involves transformation through redefinition of its business concepts, reorganization of its business relationships and reengineering of its business processes. Creating a new venture from scratch is challenging, but developing it within an existing organization is a totally different ball game. This module focuses on corporate entrepreneurship with four key elements: new business venturing, innovativeness, selfrenewal and proactiveness. It has two primary objectives. First, the module aims to enable the students to apply corporate entrepreneurship-related concepts in practice. Second, it seeks to broaden the students’ education by helping them to appreciate the application of corporate entrepreneurship knowledge to companies. The students will also have the opportunity to meet corporate entrepreneurs to understand their challenges and strategic approaches in creating and capturing value for their organizations.",

Because of the many components in marketing, doing it on a global scale involves having to work with different levels of economic, educational, infrastructural, legal, political and cultural development. Global marketing adds exponential complexity to the task of marketing.",

    "description": "This is a course that is meant for two important marketing mix variables, channel management and pricing. In Channel Management, not much attention is usually paid to understanding marketing channels in detail. In fact people used to call channels the `dark continent of marketing, that is best left to `truckers?. But, is this true? One can make at least four observations: long term commitment of channel related decisions, existence of channel power play, market dynamics caused by channel changes, and the impact of internet on channel intermediaries. All these issues are very difficult to comprehend and solve if we do not understand what channels are for. Channel management is not just managing the retailers and the trucks and delivery personnel, but it is much larger than that. In Pricing, the one element of marketing strategy that is least understood and hence constantly feared by many managers is pricing. This is because pricing is a very complex issue. On one hand, it is supposed to reflect all the strategic steps the company has taken to bring the product to the consumer and convince him/her to buy it as well. On the other hand, it is supposed to reflect what the consumer would get out of the product by paying that price to acquire it. Will there be a match between the two? Perhaps and perhaps not. This dilemma makes it imperative for a manager needs to understand and analyze various factors in arriving at an appropriate pricing strategy. And, pricing does not operate in vacuum. It has to be married with other elements of the marketing strategy, including the channel management we discuss in this course. Thus, understanding the broader picture of the various elements of pricing, and building a scientific framework on pricing will always be reliable and better in the long run.",

Second is to introduce\nthe diversity of business environments in Asia—the range is as diverse as exists worldwide. There is no single Asian business environment, but instead\nmany different environments, each of which has different implications for business strategy. In canvassing global firm strategy, it is expected that students will learn a basic set of descriptive facts about various countries and top businesses in the region. Frameworks that fit one context may be useless for another. In this course, the emphasis is not on filling in frameworks and applying standard recipes. On the contrary, students will be expected to challenge recipes, question received wisdom, and exhibit unconventional thinking – all traits required to conduct effective global strategy worldwide.",

This course provides students the opportunity to develop a deep understanding of family firms across Asia, with examples from ASEAN countries, India, China, Korea, and Japan. Aside from a focus on how to sustain a family firm from the perspective of the family, the course will also analyze family firms from an outsider’s perspective, including investors, partners, executives, and policy makers.",

    "description": "This module is divided into two parts. The goal of the first half is to help students develop an intuitive understanding of strategy as a process which will be useful in the second half of the module when we apply this process directly in the context of innovations for emerging markets. While we cover a set of strategic tools, the emphasis is not on filling in frameworks and applying standard recipes. On the contrary, students will be expected to challenge recipes, question received wisdom, and exhibit an understanding of how to apply the frameworks to solve strategic obstacles.\nWhile the cases and the examples used in the module are primarily based on Asia, the lessons from this module apply more generally to emerging markets across Africa and Latin America. Rather than looking for one “right” answer, this module encourages debates and discussions. In some ways, this module is a cross between an executive education module on strategy formulation and implementation and a module on Asian business. Our goal is to help students develop the strategic intuition and tools they need to succeed in these emerging battlegrounds for tomorrow.",

We will also compare and contrast Zheng He’s AoC with the classic Sun Zi’s Art of War (AoW), considering especially the values and principles embedded in these, and evaluating as to when companies should adopt the AoW and/or the AoC.\nThe module will also attempt to move beyond Zheng He to explore related issues, such as similarities and differences between the western and Asian approaches to collaboration and leadership, the idea of Collaborative Quotient (CQ) and its measurement, the modern day relevance of Zheng He’s key act of collaboration in his practice of generosity, and also the practice of collaboration as seen in the world of insects, birds and animals.",

    "title": "Managing Business Networks",
    "description": "This is a course in the design, management, and leadership of networks. It will examine a variety of business-related networks. These include entrepreneurial networks of resource providers and alliance partners; networks of communication and coordination within established organizations; supply chain and marketing channel networks; informal networks in and outside organizations that confer influence and advance careers; cross-border networks for doing business globally.\nManaging in the contemporary global economy is much more about managing networks than hierarchical organizations through fixed chains of command. Both within organizations and between them, the paths to productivity, innovation, and success lie in astute networking. Network management and leadership demand different capabilities from those necessary to run a single firm or division within it. Communication, persuasion, collaboration, negotiation, emotional intelligence, flexibility, trust-building, reciprocity, and responsiveness are all essential. However, good network management requires more than “soft” or interpersonal skills. Given the complexity of business networks today, familiarity with the technical tools of network analysis can be very helpful as well. A highly technical science of networks now exists. Managers should learn how to use that science in analyzing and engineering their networks for superior performance.\nWe will approach the problem of managing networks from two perspectives, “up” and “down.” “Up” refers to your vantage point as an individual actor, crafting your personal network, positioning yourself within it, and leveraging it for professional advantage and success. “Down” is your vantage point as an executive charged with responsibility for the functioning and success of the network as a whole; for example, within a division or functional area or a supply chain or distribution system.",

This course allows you to understand family firms from the perspective of the owning family, outside professionals working in family firms, business partners, employees of family offices, investors in family firms and policy makers. The topics include strategy, growth, ownership, innovation, governance, professionalisation, and succession patterns in family firms, as well as an investor and policy perspective. The course is open to students from all NUS faculties and to exchange students interested understanding business in Asia. For students from business families or entrepreneurs building their own firms this course will be particularly relevant as it will provide the knowledge to run and sustain family businesses for generations. For other students, the course will be useful no matter which career you pursue, as you will most likely work with family firms either as your employers, clients, suppliers, or partners.",

An ASEAN that is tighter in economic integration is pivotal as China is more aggressively competitive since the 1970s with India awakening as well. This course will focus on ASEAN-plus business opportunities for Singapore-based companies to forge business alliances and ventures to tap natural resources in production and markets for sales and revenue.",

As such, family firms play an important role in all economies, but especially so in Asian economies, where large family firms often constitute a large part of the private sector. Large Asian family firms - the focus of this course - are often organized into corporate groups, and this type of economic organization has lost its attractiveness in many other parts of the developed world, but continues to be important in most emerging economies. In many ways, the Asian family firm defies the wisdom of strategic management. Its demise continues to be predicted, but does not appear imminent. This course provides students the opportunity to develop deep skills and understanding of the strategy and governance of family firms, and focuses in particular on strategic issues faced by family firms in Asia. Topics include characteristics, strengths and weaknesses of family ownership and management, succession of ownership and leadership, governance of family businesses, and how to grow and sustain the legacy of family business. The knowledge obtained from this course is particularly essential to doing business intelligently with family firms not only in Asia and other emerging economies but also in developed countries.",

Treating Singapore-Malaysia\nas a nexus to consider its literary relations in\nthe long 20th century with other localities (e.g.,\nmainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong), this course\nintroduces the critical concept of “place” to account for\nthe shifting attributes and implications of the cultural\nlinkages affecting our perspectives on literary heritage.\nThrough literary texts that address questions of\nsojourn, mobility and migration, it highlights the\nimportance of historicisation when analysing literary\ntransregionalism and shows how geographical distance\ndoes not necessarily co-relate with the strength of\nconnections.",

    "description": "In Southeast Asia, the global Cold War coincided with the decolonization process when newly-emerging independent nations were eager to seek powerful international allies and vice versa. As long-term sojourners and settlers in the region, the Chinese migrants and their local-born descendants arguably saw the height of the Cold War as the most challenging period. Although they have experienced creolization and acculturation in their country of destination and birth, their allegiances became suspect after China came under the communist rule. This course examines the policies and experiences of ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia during the Cold War and its aftermath.",

This heterogeneity, coupled with the complexity of embedded software and the complex features of modern processors make performance analysis of such systems a difficult problem. In recent years, there has been a lot of work in this area, especially because of its practical importance. In this course, we will discuss some of this work with the aim of getting a broad overview of this area. These will include formal models, algorithms, various simulation techniques, tools and case studies in the specific context of embedded systems, which significantly differ from techniques used for the performance analysis of general computer systems. Our focus will be on system-level design techniques, with the aim of critically accessing known models and methods in terms of their generality and ability at different stages of an embedded system design process. This course will be suitable for both graduate students and honors-year undergraduate students, who are interested in the general area of Computer Engineering. The projects/assignments will consist of a mix of theory and implementation and there will be enough flexibility to incline more towards one or the other direction.",

Tropical coastlines support some of the highest densities of human population worldwide. The high biodiversity in unique habitat also provide rich fisheries and mineral resources. Prudent management of such a complex ecosystem requires a good knowledge and understanding of not only its physical, chemical and biological components, but also the interactions between these components. The nature of these interactions is often unique to the tropics, and most of these are poorly understood. The module provides a systematic approach to understanding the nature of the tropical environment, drawing from local, regional and international examples. Impacts of human activities, and the tools and techniques needed for management, will be discussed. The course is directed at students at the post-graduate level from the M.Sc.

The distinguishing feature of this demonstration is the recognition of the laws of thermodynamics and ecological resilience.\nThe microeconomic analysis will begin with a critical review of basic concepts pertaining to consumption, preferences, demand, production, costs and markets. The standard approaches to natural resource management would be then considered in the light of this critical review. The internalization of thermodynamic principles and other scientific paradigms into the analytic frameworks of microeconomics can prompt deviations from the standard approaches to resource management.\nThe macroeconomic analysis begins with methods of environmental accounting, which recognizes nature as capital besides labour and manufactured capital. The validity of this perception will be tested by recourse to a simple macroeconomic framework, which explicitly regards all natural resources as an aggregate item of capital. The class will be guided towards the formulation and application of this macroeconomic framework for the analysis of sustainable development.\nThe final section of the course concerns the assembly of various management policies that strive for sustainable development.",

From an expert driven blueprint to the bottom-up public engagement, there is a constant flow of data that directly and indirectly aid them in their work. This module aims to furnish students with the appropriate tools to use when dealing with qualitative data. Some of them include field study, survey and interview, questionnaire design and site inspections, which will be applicable to urban planning analyses. \n\nStudents will appreciate the discourse on quantitative versus qualitative data and the central ideas in qualitative research - appropriateness of methods and theories; perspectives of the participants and their diversity; reflexivity of the researcher and the research; variety of approaches; and methods in qualitative research. \n\nThe course emphasizes on “hands on” with actual field work forming the bulk of the learning process and provides the opportunity for students to learn to collect, analyze and present qualitative data relating to planning and urban issues. This would encourage a better appreciation of the social issues in the urban context.",

While many companies recognize the importance of analysing their supply chains, most of them perform the analysis using experience and intuition with very few analytical models. In contrast, the academic community has developed various models and tools for supply chain management. This course intends to fill this gap by discussing state-of-the-art models, strategies, and solution methods that are important for supply chain management. Impact of trade tension and disruption caused by COVID-19 will be discussed too.",

It is designed to equip students with the standard tools and techniques to analyze microeconomic issues and to prepare them to access higher level modules that utilize microeconomic analysis. \n\n\n\nThe module begins with a review of several foundation topics on consumer and producer theory covered in the prerequisite course, i.e. EC2101.  It then moves on to discuss the general equilibrium model, whereby consumers and producers are put together in a general equilibrium framework.  After that, it covers choice over time, i.e. inter-temporal choice and choices over different states of the world, i.e. choices under uncertainty. It then continues with game theory. This topic will be discussed extensively. Coverage will include various solution concepts for one-shot games and sequential move games.  Applications of the theory on the issues of oligopolistic competition, entry and entry prevention, and network economics will receive a great deal of attention. Finally, the module ends with the asymmetric information, i.e. moral hazard and adverse selection and its application on the internal organisation of the firm. Throughout the course, empirical observations and real-life cases pertaining to the issues discussed in this module are presented.",

We next examine the expectations-augmented Phillips Curve, and simple inflation-unemployment dynamics.  We also study further policy issues (time inconsistency, Ricardian Equivalence, profit-sharing), open-economy macroeconomics (the Mundell-Fleming model), and simple growth theory (the Solow model and the AK endogenous growth model).",

Today no major currency is tied to gold, and monetary policy is independent. Employing the tools presented in International Finance I, the course discusses how the system has operated throughout time and why it changed.

At each step their compatibility with the concepts of globalization will be reviewed. The tutorial will deepen this study in analyzing pertinent corporate histories and biographies of important business leaders active in the different business cultures under review. The objective is to raise students' awareness of intercultural differences in business and organizational behaviour and communication at both practical and analytical level. This should be useful for future careers in globally operating corporations or international organizations. As the course is interdisciplinary in nature (covering economics, sociology, psychology and business administration), interested students from other faculties are encouraged to attend. Basic economic literacy, practical experience in business organizations and some overseas travel are a plus.",

    "description": "Behavioral economics stresses the need to incorporate psychological considerations into economic thinking. Experimental economics, including lab and field experiments, builds on the premise that theoretical implications are subject to testing in controlled laboratory settings. There is a natural synergy between them and neuoroimaging and genetics leading to the development of neuroeconomics. This course covers the growing literature in behavioral and experimental economics, including neuroeconomics, and study individual differences in economic behaviour beyond those explicable by culture and socialization towards a deeper understanding of business and market behavior.",

Frugal engineering involves rethinking entire production and maintainance processes. It is not only a challenging mindset to inculcate in young budding engineers, but it is also a rich training ground to foster critical thinking skills which are pertinent to conceptualizing products that\nmaximizes the value to customers. The objectives of this module is to expose students to frugal engineering through a field trip to the rural communities in the region to observe first-hand the way of life in such communities and to develop ideas of products which will bring benefit to a large segment of this community. Students will also engage with industries with a frugal engineering focus.",

Currently there are three major\ntypes of information storage technologies, i.e., magnetic data storage, optical disks, and solid-state memories. Although the operation principles are different, the common driving force for all these surface-based information storage technologies in the last few decades was the reduction of bit size so as to make it possible to store more data on a specific surface area. As a result, all these data storage devices are now operating in the nanometer regime. This module adopts a model-based approach to introduce information storage through focusing on the basic principles of various types of data storage systems and the associated roles of\nnanotechnology in each field. Emphasis will be on materials, devices and technologies that have made it possible to maintain a remarkable growth rate in storage density in the last decades and emerging technologies for tackling challenges ahead.

Such dynamics are captured in the form of electromechanical oscillations, and are inherent to power grids. From the utility perspective, poorly damped oscillations can trigger rotor-angle instability and cause wide-area blackouts. Hence, real-time assessment using advanced sensors like Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) are used to improve grid stability. Additionally, proper design of the excitation system in a synchronous generators is critical. This module provides a holistic view of identifying and mitigating stability issues among synchronous generators.",

This module takes into account no previous knowledge of Neurolinguistics, and will rely on a combination of mini lectures, student‐led discussions and seminar presentations to help students navigate through the maze of new terms, methods and analyses they will encounter.",

Students will come to understand the motivations for such theories and are invited to evaluate what they had previously learnt in other syntax modules vis-à-vis the contents of this module.",

In this module, students will learn objective and practical methods by which they may collect and analyse acceptability judgments. We will discuss experimental design, data visualisation, statistical analysis, and the application of experimental methods to theoretical questions. This will be a hands-on course, and students will be expected to lead discussions on primary research.",

However, linguists have often questioned the need for such rules, arguing that these phenomena can be more fruitfully understood as the product of sentence processing and cognitive constraints, such as the limits of working memory. This module introduces students to these perspectives, their underlying assumptions, and their successes and limitations. Through this module, students will also become more familiar with the logic of linguistics experiments and statistical analysis.",

Students will encounter a century characterised by extensive aesthetic innovation, active political engagement and the acute registering of social change. Subjects covered include modernism, postmodernism and issues of art, language and representation. Writers we study may include T. S.

But they disagreed sharply about the nature of those implications.

    "description": "This module offers an introduction to the study of art, film and media culture. It explores the changing role of visual media across the centuries, from pre‐modern societies through to today’s digital, networked cultures. How have technological and economic changes generated new visual media? How have these media in turn shaped social and economic life? A range of case studies will be drawn from art history, film, popular culture and online media. What are the differences between art, film and other visual culture, and are these differences still relevant in the ‘convergent’ world of digital media culture?",

Through a range of writerly forms and cultural media, we identify the post‐colonial in the question of “tradition” and its centrality to “non‐Western” modernity; in inscriptions of race/ethnicity/sexuality into Third World humanism; as the mourning for a vanishing past; as aesthetic resistance to homogenizing processes of modernization.",

It will examine how different styles or modes of narration have been deployed to contend or cope with illnesses. It will also look into how these narratives reflect the problematics of identity, subjectivity, ontology, existence, and community that illness brings with it. Writers read may include Woolf, Lorde, Sontag, Sedgwick, Cvetkovich, and Boyer.",

Significantly, the culture was also shaped by a theology that identified performance with evil. The module aims to provide students with an understanding of the culture of the period as well as a survey of its drama. The module is designed for advanced undergraduate English majors, preferably those who have taken at least one other module in English literature before 1700.",

Part one explores the tension between religion, science, and philosophy in the prose and poetry of the early eighteenth century, and the impact that new ways of conceiving the world had on social, cultural, intellectual and religious thinking. Part two explores the tension between tradition and individual expression in the poetry and painting of the second half of the century, and the variety of ways in which they reveal a new sensibility.",

Students will examine modernism as both a reaction to and a constituent part of modernity and will produce informed critical arguments about the historical, economic and technological developments that constitute modernity.
